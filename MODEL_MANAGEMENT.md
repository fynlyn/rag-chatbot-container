# Model Management Features

## Overview
The RAG chatbot now includes comprehensive model management capabilities that allow users to browse, download, install, and manage LLM models through both the web UI and REST API.

## Web UI Features

### ðŸ¤– Models Tab
The web interface now includes a "Models" tab with the following functionality:

1. **Current Model Display**: Shows which model is currently active
2. **Available Models**: Browse popular models optimized for RAG
3. **Installed Models**: View and manage currently installed models
4. **One-Click Operations**: Download, activate, and remove models with simple clicks

### Model Cards
Each model is displayed in a card format showing:
- **Model Name**: e.g., `llama3.2:3b`
- **Status Badge**: Available, Installed, Downloading, Error
- **Model Info**: Parameter size (e.g., 3B), Download size (e.g., ~2GB)
- **Description**: Brief description of model capabilities
- **Action Buttons**: Download, Use This Model, Remove

### Real-Time Updates
- Download progress is displayed in real-time
- Status updates automatically without page refresh
- Visual indicators for model states (colors, badges)

## Usage Examples

### Via Web UI

2. Click the "ðŸ¤– Models" tab
3. Browse available models
4. Click "Download" on desired model
5. Wait for download to complete
6. Click "Use This Model" to activate

### Via API
```bash
# List available models
curl http://localhost:8000/models/available

# Download a model
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/models/download \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model_name": "qwen2:1.5b"}'

# Check download status
curl http://localhost:8000/models/download/status/qwen2:1.5b

# Set active model
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/models/set-active \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model_name": "qwen2:1.5b"}'
```

## Background Processing
- Model downloads happen in the background
- Users can continue using the system while models download
- Download status is tracked and can be queried
- Automatic cleanup of download status after completion

## Error Handling
- Network failures are handled gracefully
- Download errors are reported to the user
- Invalid model names are rejected
- Proper HTTP status codes for all operations

## Integration
The model management system is fully integrated with:
- The existing chat functionality
- Configuration system (updates active model)
- Status endpoint (shows current model info)
- Web UI (seamless tab switching)

This provides users with complete control over their RAG system's language models without needing command-line access or Docker knowledge.
